"Living organisms are consummate problem solvers. They exhibit a versatility that puts the best computer programs to shame. This observation is
especially galling for computer scientists, who may spend months or years of intellectual effort on an algorithm, whereas organisms come by their abilities
through the apparently undirected mechanism of evolution and natural selection.
Pragmatic researchers see evolutionâ€™s remarkable power as something to be emulated rather than envied. Natural selection eliminates one of the greatest
hurdles in software design: specifying in advance all the features of a problem and the actions a program should take to deal with them. By harnessing the
mechanisms of evolution, researchers may be able to "breed" programs that solve problems even when no person can fully understand their structure.
Indeed, these so-called genetic algorithms have already demonstrated the ability to made breakthroughs in the design of such complex systems as jet
engines. 
Genetic algorithms make it possible to explore a far greater range of potential solutions to a problem than do conventional programs. Furthermore, as
researchers probe the natural selection of programs under controlled an well-understood conditions, the practical results they achieve may yield some
insight into the details of how life and intelligence evolve in the natural world."
